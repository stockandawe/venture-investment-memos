# Venture Investment Memos

Until recently, getting insights into how Venture Capitalist make investment decisions, was a bit of a black box. However, with more VCs sharing details about their criteria, processes, and even assets like deal memos, that is changing.

This is a collection of venture capital deal memos that are in the public domain.

### Seed Stage

A public draft of the investment memo that VC fund Earnest Captial was planning to use to raise capitla for it's second fund. Earnest Capital uses a different model than most other VCs of Shared Earnings Agreements which makes this an even more interesting read.
